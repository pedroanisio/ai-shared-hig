### . 

**Definition :**
$L = (stream, buffer, processor, emitter)$

- $stream : Stream⟨Event⟩$ is continuous event stream

**Type Definitions:**
```
Event := (timestamp: Time, data: Data, metadata: Metadata)
ProcessedEvent := Validated and enriched event
Subscriber := (id: String, callback: ProcessedEvent → Effect)
```

**Properties:**

**P.F1.3.1 (Ordering Preservation):**
```
∀e₁, e₂ ∈ Stream: timestamp(e₁) < timestamp(e₂) ⇒
process_order(e₁) < process_order(e₂)
```

**P.F1.3.2 (Backpressure Handling):**
```
|buffer| > threshold ⇒ apply_backpressure(stream)
```

**P.F1.3.3 (At-Least-Once Delivery):**
```
∀e ∈ Stream: processed(e) ⇒ ∃s ∈ Subscribers: delivered(e, s)
```

**Operations:**

1. **Stream:**
   ```
   stream(source: Source) → Effect
   ```
   ```
   stream(source: Source) → Effect
      = for event in source.events():
          buffer.enqueue(event)
          if buffer.full():
            apply_backpressure()
          process_next()
   ```

2. **Process:**
   ```
   process(event: Event) → ProcessedEvent
   ```
   ```
   process(event: Event) → ProcessedEvent
      = validated := validate(event)
        enriched := enrich(validated)
        return enriched
   ```

3. **Emit:**
   ```
   emit(event: ProcessedEvent) → Effect
   ```
   ```
   emit(event: ProcessedEvent) → Effect
      = for subscriber in subscribers:
          subscriber.callback(event)
   ```

**Manifestations:**
- Real-time data feeds
- WebSocket connections
- Event streaming (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Live metrics collection
- Chat/messaging systems
